ðŸ§  Simple RNN Implementation
This project is a basic implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from scratch (or using a framework like PyTorch/TensorFlow, depending on your implementation). The goal is to understand how RNNs work and process sequential data such as time series, text, or other sequences.

ðŸš€ Features
Single-layer RNN structure

Forward pass and training loop

Sequence input processing

Loss calculation and backpropagation

Easily customizable for different sequence learning tasks
ðŸ“š Learning Objectives
Understand the step-by-step logic behind RNNs

See how sequence data is processed over time

Practice implementing from scratch or using deep learning frameworks

Modify for character-level, word-level, or numeric sequences
